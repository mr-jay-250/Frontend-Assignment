## Description of the project

We can write/paste the JSON in the `JSON Editor` for the form we want to generate. You can see that form in the `Form Preview` section. Upon clicking `Submit` for selected fields, you can view the data on [https://65c49822dae2304e92e2e387.mockapi.io/api/form-response](https://65c49822dae2304e92e2e387.mockapi.io/api/form-response). I have also implemented the function to send the data to the backend.
